# PrimeNumber
This is a solution for a technical test for Find My Past.

It consists of a library, unit tests and a simple console application. The console application creates a CSV file after a prompt for a positive integer number.

The application generates a square matrix of prime numbers and the multiplication of the numbers for the content of the cells.

The project implements many of the SOLID principles such as using interfaces, dependency injection, open closed keep simple. I believe that it is extendible and simple.
